    "Both PCA and LDA are linear transformation techniques that can be used to reduce the number of dimensions in a dataset; the former is an unsupervised algorithm, whereas the latter is supervised. Thus, we might think that LDA is a superior feature extraction technique for classification tasks compared to PCA. However, *A.M.
