# Introduction to Machine Learning (2020)

This course introduces the student to Machine Learning topics emphasizing techniques rather than statistical demonstrations of methods. This does not mean that they are not rigorously determined, but rather that the consistency demonstrations of the classifiers will only be determined.

The course will begin with a discussion on the differences between Machine Learning and Classic Multivariate Analysis, recalling the concepts derived from Bayes 'Theorem and the definition of the modified classifier according to Bayes' Risk. Supervised classification is one of the central themes of the course, which will be addressed from various aspects of Statistical Learning.

In the practical part, the python scikit-learn toolkit is presented.

Other central issues in the area will be discussed, such as dimensionality reduction, database assembly, error computation and performance measures.
